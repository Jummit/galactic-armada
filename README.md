The galactic federation rules the galaxy with an iron fist. The rebel force remainhopeful of freedom's dying light. This is a basic gameboy shmup for RGBDS. More info can be found here: https://rgbds.gbdev.io/. A guide will be created to show developers how to create their own SHMUP, you can find that guide here: (https://gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial/index.html)[https://gbdev.io/gb-asm-tutorial/index.html]

This demo utilizes assembly, for those not familiar (or willing to embark on the painful journey of learning as they go), check out [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020). GBDK-2020 is a C library also for making gameboy games. I've also written a series of [GBDK tutorials on my website.](https://laroldsjubilantjunkyard.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-gameboy-game/)
